The git repository is intended for everyone interested in contributing or seeing how the code works.

We currently have set up an online version of Uriel [http://competition.ia-toki.org](http://competition.ia-toki.org). **Note: [http://competition.ia-toki.org](http://competition.ia-toki.org) is not always online at the moment.**
